              <p>While it is true that being careful will make you safer it will not stop fire from happening.</p>
              <p>Most fires are not caused from carelessness.</p>
              <p>They are caused from every day living that is almost impossible for us to change.</p>

            <p>Older homes are particularly susceptible, as they were not wired for the many, many appliances that we have filled our homes with. </p>
          <p>Many homes that were built in the 50′s -70′s have aluminum wiring that gets very hot and increases the chance of fire.
